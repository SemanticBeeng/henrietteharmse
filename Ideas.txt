1. The biggest tech villian: The Singularity vs Rampant Software Complexity
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
See https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/09/saving-the-world-from-code/540393/.

Many state that steps has to be taken to curb AI abilities before the arival of the Singularity. As Andrew Ng stated aptly: It is a bit like worrying about over population on Mars. That is we may need to worry about at some point in the future, but it is helleshly premature to worry about it now. Especially, when we have other problems at hand that happening already which we seem to do very little about. The most threatening issue at hand is rampant software complexity. And yes, AI makes it worse. Not only do we have millions lines of spaghetti code, but we also now add layer-upon-layer of statistical inference on top of it. In time it will be impossible for software engineers to determine the source of failures. Thus, the systems our lifelihood depends on will come crushing down causing the colapse of surrounding economies. All this will happen while software engineers helplessly lookon without the ability 
to determine the cause of the failures. Without understanding the cause a failure it cannot be corrected with confidence. The only solution? Start from scratch.


2. Software Maintenance is Dead!
--------------------------------
Software maintenance does not exist in the same sense as for example car maintenance. Most software maintenance is actually bug fixing or enhancements, not actual maintenance. That is the equivalence of waiting till your car breaks down and then repairing it. 

3. Agile promotes spaghetti code
--------------------------------
Piecemeal user stories result in design in the small rather than design in the large.
